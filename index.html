        <h3>A Quick Bio</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a 21 year old New York City native with little experiece in coding, but some experience in the sales/customer service and IT Support industries. I hope to utilize this course to jumpstart my career in coding so that I can at least create websites better looking than this one. My hobbies include playing video games such as Valorant, League of Legends(TFT), and Grand Theft Auto 5. I also enjoy building and repairing computers whether its just to install/replace certain parts or repairing a damaged CPU/GPU.

        <h6>To whomever is viewing this website, I apologize if it is a bit barebones. Unfortunately due to conditions out of my control I was forced to build this website on a rather strict time constraint. I can only hope that I'm able to improve this site to the best of my capabilities over time. Until then, please bear with me.</h6>
